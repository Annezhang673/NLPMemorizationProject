# NLPMemorizationProject

- generate canaries using a template
  - Template: <name> suffer from <disease>
- Add canaries to the dataset and vary the frequency of occurrence
- Train the model
- Generate tokens using template 'n' times - different decoding algorithms (topK, beam search, greedy, nucleous smapling)
- Calculate the memorization accuracy over n sentences
- Metrics: Bleu, rouge, perplexity
